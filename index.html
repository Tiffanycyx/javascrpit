<h1 id="javascript">The Old New House</h1>
<p>We bought an old house, my boyfriend and I. He's in charge of the "new" construction – converting the kitchen in to the master bedroom for instance, while I'm on wallpaper removal duty. The previous owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying. The best feeling is getting a long peel, similar to your skin when you're peeling from a sunburn. I don't know about you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips.</p>

        Under a corner section of paper in every room is a person’s name and a <span id="word01"></span>. Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered the person was actually a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. Sure enough each name was for a missing person with dates to match.
        I <span id="word02"></span> to the police station.
        The next morning I arrived at the <span id="word03"></span> police station. We notified the police who naturally sent out the crime scene team.
        I overhead one <span id="word04"></span>. say "yup, it's human." Human? What's human?
        My hands started shaking <span id="word05"></span>. "Ma'am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn't wallpaper you were removing."
